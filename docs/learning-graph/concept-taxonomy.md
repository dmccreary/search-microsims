# Concept Taxonomy

This document defines the categorical taxonomy for organizing the 200 concepts in the MicroSim Search and Similarity course.

## Taxonomy Categories

| Category Name | TaxonomyID | Description |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| Foundation Concepts | FOUND | Core MicroSim concepts, definitions, and fundamental principles |
| Metadata Standards | META | Dublin Core elements, metadata standards, and resource description |
| Data Formats | DATA | JSON, schemas, validation, and data quality |
| Search Methods | SRCH | Search fundamentals, keyword, boolean, faceted, and semantic search |
| Embeddings & Similarity | EMBED | Vector representations, similarity calculations, and recommendations |
| Educational Theory | EDU | Bloom's taxonomy, learning objectives, cognitive load, scaffolding |
| User Interface | UI | Controls, layouts, visualization types, and interaction design |
| Technical Implementation | TECH | JavaScript libraries, responsive design, performance, accessibility |
| Data Pipeline | PIPE | Web crawling, data gathering, repositories, and aggregation |
| Analytics & Assessment | ANAL | Learning analytics, engagement metrics, assessment rubrics |
| Standards & Compliance | STND | Curriculum standards, privacy regulations, and compliance |
| File Structure | FILE | MicroSim file organization and standard file types |

## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundation Concepts
Core concepts that define what MicroSims are, their purpose, and fundamental characteristics like interactivity, simplicity, and reuse.

### META - Metadata Standards
All concepts related to Dublin Core metadata elements and general metadata standards for resource description and discovery.

### DATA - Data Formats
JSON syntax, schemas, validation, data quality scoring, and related data structure concepts.

### SRCH - Search Methods
Search fundamentals including precision, recall, keyword search, boolean operators, faceted search, and search engine concepts.

### EMBED - Embeddings & Similarity
Semantic search concepts including embeddings, vector representations, cosine similarity, and similar MicroSim recommendations.

### EDU - Educational Theory
Learning science concepts including Bloom's taxonomy levels, cognitive load theory, scaffolding techniques, and learning theories.

### UI - User Interface
User interface elements including control types (sliders, buttons, dropdowns), layout patterns, visualization types, and interaction levels.

### TECH - Technical Implementation
Technical aspects including JavaScript libraries (p5.js, chart.js, etc.), responsive design, canvas dimensions, and accessibility features.

### PIPE - Data Pipeline
Data collection concepts including web crawling, GitHub API, repository mining, tags, and folksonomies.

### ANAL - Analytics & Assessment
Learning analytics, engagement metrics, assessment rubrics, and progress tracking concepts.

### STND - Standards & Compliance
Curriculum standards (CCSS, NGSS, ISTE), privacy regulations (FERPA, GDPR), and compliance requirements.

### FILE - File Structure
MicroSim file organization including index.md, main.html, style.css, data.json, and metadata.json files.
