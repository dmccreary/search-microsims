# Add Missing Metadata

!!! prompt
    create a new python program that scans all of the             
  directories in @/Users/dan/Documents/ws/*/docs/sims and       
  if there is no metadata.json file, it will use the            
  micorsim-util standardization skill to add a new              
  metadata.json file to that sim directory.  Use the source     
  code at @src/update-local-microsims.py for tips on how        
  to scan the local file system to find the MicroSim            
  directories.  If you don't see enough information in the      
  MicroSim directory add a file called TODO.md that has a       
  list of tasks to do to fix the MicroSim metadata later.
