# Generate MicroSim Using Similar Templates

## MicroSim Generator Skill with Similar Templates

!!! prompt
    Run the microsim-generator skill using as input the input from @docs/chapters/02-microsim-file-organization/index.md        
    and look for the #### Diagram: MicroSim Directory Structure.  You will find a <details> block following that Diagram        
    level 4 markdown header.  Use the program @src/find-similar-templates/find-similar-templates.py to find similar             
    MicroSim templates you can begin with.  Keep a detailed log of your decision of what parts of what templates to use to      
    generate the new MicroSim and put your design decisions in @logs/generate-microsim-directory-structure-microsim.md

Result:
