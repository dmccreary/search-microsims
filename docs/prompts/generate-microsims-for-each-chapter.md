## Generate MicroSims for Each Chapter

## Chapter 1 MicroSims
Set the context to @docs/chapters/01-intro-to-microsims/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each
diagram:

1. Use text within the <details markdown="1"> as input specification to the
microsim-generator skill to generate a microsim for each diagram.
2. Update the chapter content with an iframe element immediately after 
the #### Diagram: that links to the new MicroSim.
3. Update the mkdocs.yml file so the navigation has links to the new Microsims.

When done, add a session log to logs/ch-01-microsims.md

## Chapter 2 MicroSims
Set the context to @docs/chapters/02-microsim-file-organization/index.md.
Go through all of the level 4 diagram headers (#### Diagram:) and for each
diagram:

1. Use text within the <details markdown="1"> as input specification to the

2. Update the chapter content with an iframe element immediately after 
the #### Diagram: that links to the new MicroSim.
