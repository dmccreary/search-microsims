# About the MicroSim Search and Similarity

This is an interactive intelligent textbook about the topic of the creation
and modification of search engines that help you find and reuse a large
collection of educational MicroSims.

Educational MicroSims are standardized interactive components that can be placed into any web-based textbook using an iframe.  They are designed to be simile, modular
components that are easy for generative AI programs to create and modify.
However, often the best way to create a new MicroSim is to modify an existing
MicroSim.  That is why this book is so important!  Our research shows that
over 90% of the errors generated by an generative AI system can be avoided
by starting out with a working template and modifying it following a prescribed
set of carefully controlled design rules.

But finding the right MicroSim template to begin with is often challenging.
Because it is so easy to generate MicroSims, they vary dramatically in
quality and consistency.  They also may lack both metadata and documentation
such as how to use a MicroSim in a lesson plan.

This textbook is designed to not only be used as a MicroSim search engine, but also
a tool for allowing you to build your own MicroSim search engine.  It comes with
a detailed instructions on how the powerful faceted search engine works as well as
how to create embeddings for your MicroSims.
