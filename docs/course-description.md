# MicroSim Search and and Similarity Course Description

**Course Title:** MicroSim Search and and Similarity
**Target Audience:** Eductors or software developers building and customizing MicroSim search tools
**Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge of how to use web browsers and search tools

## Overview

This course teaches readers how to create high-quality search and retrieval applications
that work with MicroSim metadata. These MicroSim search applications and services can be used
by both humans and intelligent agents. We will show how to use these services to create better
AI MicroSim generators. Finding the right MicroSim is critical for building
high-reuse systems where instructors can quickly leverage the work of
others and extend the features of a MicroSim for their classroom.
We show that great search and similarity measures can help AI MicroSim 
generators by using the ideal set of MicroSims to reference when
they are building new MicroSims that have a consistent working user interface.

## Target Audience

The ideal audience for this course is someone that is already familiar with MicroSim
or is curious about how teachers or instructional designers can reuse other similar
components. We don't expect our audience to have a strong background in search and we
cover all the basics of search and metadata in our introductory chapters.

## Prerequisites

All students should have access to the web and be able to use a modern browser.
Users should be familiar with how web search engines work and how search
results are ranked according to relevancy.
There are additional optional exercises and labs at the end of the course that
are targeting software developers that want to customize these search tools. 
However, these advanced exercises and labs are optional.
