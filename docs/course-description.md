# Course Description

## Overview

This course teaches readers how to create high-quality search and retrieval applications
that work with MicroSim metadata.  Finding the right MicroSim is critical for
building high-reuse cultures where instructors can quickly leverage the work of
others and extend the the features of a MicroSim for their classroom.

## Prerequisites

The ideal audience for this course is someone that is already familiar with MicroSim
or is curious about how teachers or instructional designers can reuse other similar
components.  We don't expect our audience to have a strong background in search and we
cover all the basics of search in our introductory chapters.

All students should have access to the web and be able to use a modern browser.
There are additional optional exercises and labs at the end of the course that
are targeting software developers that want to customize these search tools.  However, these advanced exercises and labs are optional.
