# Technical Implementation

## Summary

This chapter covers the technical aspects of MicroSim development including JavaScript libraries, responsive design, accessibility, and analytics. You'll learn about popular frameworks (p5.js, mermaid.js, vis-network.js, chart.js, vis-timeline.js, plotly.js, leaflet.js), responsive design techniques for width-responsive and fixed-height layouts, canvas and control regions, browser compatibility, and performance considerations. The chapter also covers accessibility features including screen reader support and keyboard navigation, as well as analytics for measuring learning indicators and engagement. After completing this chapter, students will be able to implement technically sound MicroSims.
