# Quiz: Learning Theory and Pedagogy

Test your understanding of cognitive load theory and learning principles with these questions.

#### 1. What is cognitive load?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The weight of a computer processor
2. The mental effort required to process information
3. The amount of data a MicroSim contains
4. The number of users accessing a simulation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Cognitive load refers to the mental effort required to process information. Working memory—where active thinking happens—has limited capacity. When cognitive load exceeds this capacity, learning stops. MicroSim designers must manage cognitive load carefully.

    **Concept Tested:** Cognitive Load

#### 2. What are the three types of cognitive load?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Light, Medium, and Heavy
2. Intrinsic, Extraneous, and Germane
3. Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic
4. Short-term, Medium-term, and Long-term
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The three types of cognitive load are: Intrinsic (inherent complexity of the material), Extraneous (caused by poor instructional design), and Germane (mental effort spent on actual learning). Good design minimizes extraneous load to maximize germane learning.

    **Concept Tested:** Intrinsic Load, Extraneous Load, Germane Load

#### 3. Which type of cognitive load should MicroSim designers try to minimize?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Intrinsic load
2. Extraneous load
3. Germane load
4. All types equally
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Extraneous load comes from poor instructional design and should be minimized. Every unit of extraneous load (confusing interfaces, unnecessary distractions) steals cognitive resources from germane load, which is where actual learning happens. Intrinsic load cannot be reduced without simplifying the concept itself.

    **Concept Tested:** Extraneous Load

#### 4. What is scaffolding in educational design?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Building physical structures around computers
2. Temporary instructional support that helps learners accomplish tasks beyond their current ability
3. A method for organizing files
4. A type of search algorithm
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Scaffolding is temporary instructional support that helps learners accomplish tasks beyond their current ability, gradually removed as competence develops. Like construction scaffolding that's removed when the building can stand alone, learning scaffolds are faded as students gain mastery.

    **Concept Tested:** Scaffolding

#### 5. What is progressive disclosure?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Revealing all information at once
2. An interface design pattern that reveals information gradually as needed
3. A method for encrypting data
4. A technique for speeding up animations
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Progressive disclosure is an interface design pattern that reveals information gradually as needed, reducing initial complexity. A MicroSim might show basic controls initially with an "Advanced Options" button for additional parameters, preventing overwhelm while preserving access to depth.

    **Concept Tested:** Progressive Disclosure

#### 6. What learning theory holds that learners actively construct knowledge through experiences?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Behaviorism
2. Cognitivism
3. Constructivism
4. Experiential Learning
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Constructivism holds that learners actively construct knowledge through experiences rather than passively receiving information. MicroSims aligned with constructivism let students manipulate variables, make predictions, observe outcomes, and build their own understanding through exploration.

    **Concept Tested:** Constructivism

#### 7. What is a worked example in MicroSim design?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A broken simulation that doesn't work
2. A step-by-step demonstration showing concrete data at each stage
3. A simulation that runs automatically without user input
4. An example created by students
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A worked example is an instructional pattern showing step-by-step solutions with concrete data at each stage to build understanding. Worked examples are particularly effective for Understand-level objectives, showing learners exactly what happens at each step of a process.

    **Concept Tested:** Worked Examples

#### 8. What is the purpose of a hints system in a MicroSim?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To make the simulation more difficult
2. To provide progressive assistance to learners who are struggling
3. To display advertising messages
4. To speed up the simulation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A hints system provides progressive assistance to learners who are struggling, without giving away answers. Good hints are tiered (increasingly specific), timely (offered after evident struggle), and supportive (not condescending), helping students reach understanding independently.

    **Concept Tested:** Hints System

---

#### 9. What is a common misconception in educational contexts?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A simulation that runs too slowly
2. An incorrect belief or understanding that learners hold, which instruction should address
3. A type of search filter
4. A file format error
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Misconceptions are incorrect beliefs or understandings that learners hold, which effective instruction should address and correct. MicroSims can help reveal and correct misconceptions by letting students test their predictions against accurate simulations.

    **Concept Tested:** Misconceptions

#### 10. What is guided discovery as a pedagogical approach?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Giving students all the answers upfront
2. Combining student exploration with strategic scaffolding and hints from the system
3. Completely unstructured free play
4. Memorization of facts
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Guided discovery is an instructional approach that combines student exploration with strategic scaffolding and hints from the system or instructor. It balances the engagement of discovery learning with the efficiency of direct instruction, providing support when students get stuck.

    **Concept Tested:** Guided Discovery
