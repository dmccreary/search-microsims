# Learning Theory and Pedagogy

## Summary

This chapter explores cognitive load theory, scaffolding techniques, and learning theories relevant to effective MicroSim design. You'll learn about intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load, and how to manage them through scaffolding approaches including guided discovery, worked examples, hints, feedback mechanisms, and progressive disclosure. The chapter also covers major learning theories (constructivism, behaviorism, cognitivism, experiential learning) and addresses misconceptions and transfer skills. After completing this chapter, students will be able to apply pedagogical principles to MicroSim design.
