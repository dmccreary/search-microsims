# Data Pipelines and Aggregation

## Summary

This chapter covers the data gathering and aggregation techniques used to build a searchable collection of MicroSims. You'll learn about web crawling approaches, using the GitHub API to discover repositories, repository mining techniques for extracting metadata, and strategies for aggregating data from multiple sources. The chapter focuses on building automated pipelines that keep MicroSim collections current. After completing this chapter, students will be able to design and implement data collection pipelines for MicroSim metadata.
