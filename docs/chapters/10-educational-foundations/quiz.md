#### 1. What is the purpose of grade level metadata for MicroSims?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To limit who can access the simulation
2. To help educators quickly filter to content appropriate for their students
3. To determine the file size of the simulation
4. To set the color scheme of the interface
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Grade level metadata helps educators quickly filter to content appropriate for their students—using vocabulary students understand, presenting concepts at appropriate complexity, aligning with curriculum sequences, and not assuming prerequisite knowledge students lack.

    **Concept Tested:** Grade Levels

#### 2. What does "K-12" refer to in educational contexts?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A type of programming language
2. Kindergarten through 12th grade, the entire primary and secondary education system
3. A classification of advanced college courses
4. A software version number
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. K-12 spans kindergarten through 12th grade—the entire primary and secondary education system in the US, typically covering ages 5-18. K-12 content follows state and national curriculum standards and progresses from concrete to abstract thinking.

    **Concept Tested:** K-12 Education

#### 3. What is the key characteristic of adult learning that distinguishes it from K-12 education?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Adults cannot use interactive simulations
2. Adults are self-directed and application-focused
3. Adults only learn from textbooks
4. Adults require more supervision than children
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Adult learning is characterized by self-direction (learners choose what to study) and application focus (emphasizing practical use cases). Adults bring life experience, prefer relevant content, and often have specific professional goals that differ from the structured progression of K-12 education.

    **Concept Tested:** Adult Learning

#### 4. What is the purpose of a learning objective?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To describe the file format of a MicroSim
2. To specify what learners should know or be able to do after engagement
3. To list the technical requirements for running a simulation
4. To record how long the simulation takes to load
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A learning objective is a specific statement describing what learners should know or be able to do after engaging with educational content. Well-crafted learning objectives guide MicroSim design and help match simulations to appropriate Bloom's Taxonomy levels and curriculum needs.

    **Concept Tested:** Learning Objectives

#### 5. How many cognitive levels does Bloom's Taxonomy include?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Three (Easy, Medium, Hard)
2. Four (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
3. Six (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
4. Ten (numbered levels 1-10)
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Bloom's Taxonomy includes six cognitive levels in hierarchical order: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Each level represents increasingly complex cognitive processes, from basic recall to generating new ideas.

    **Concept Tested:** Bloom Taxonomy

---

#### 6. Which Bloom's level involves applying learned information in new situations to solve problems?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. The Apply level involves using learned information in new situations to solve problems or complete tasks. A MicroSim at the Apply level might require students to use a formula with different parameters or apply a procedure to new scenarios.

    **Concept Tested:** Apply Level

---

#### 7. What does the Analyze level of Bloom's Taxonomy require students to do?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Recall basic facts and definitions
2. Break information into parts to understand relationships and organizational principles
3. Produce new or original work
4. Make judgments based on criteria
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Analyze level involves breaking information into parts to understand relationships and organizational principles. Students identify patterns, examine components, determine causes, and explore how elements connect to each other and the whole.

    **Concept Tested:** Analyze Level

---

#### 8. What are NGSS standards?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Next Generation Science Standards, a multi-state framework for K-12 science education
2. National Grammar and Spelling Standards
3. A type of JavaScript library
4. Network and Graphics System Specifications
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. NGSS stands for Next Generation Science Standards, a multi-state framework for K-12 science education in the United States. NGSS uses three-dimensional learning (science practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas) and emphasizes engineering alongside science.

    **Concept Tested:** NGSS Standards

---

#### 9. What is the highest level of Bloom's Taxonomy?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Analyze
2. Evaluate
3. Create
4. Apply
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Create is the highest level of Bloom's Taxonomy, involving generating new ideas, products, or ways of viewing things by combining elements in novel ways. Students at this level design solutions, develop plans, and produce original work.

    **Concept Tested:** Create Level

---

#### 10. What is an assessment rubric?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A type of MicroSim visualization
2. A scoring guide listing criteria and describing quality levels for evaluating student work
3. A method for compressing files
4. A programming framework for animations
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An assessment rubric is a scoring guide that lists criteria for evaluating student work and describes levels of quality for each criterion. Rubrics clarify expectations, enable consistent evaluation, and help students understand what success looks like.

    **Concept Tested:** Assessment Rubric
