# Educational Foundations

## Summary

This chapter covers the educational framework concepts that inform MicroSim design and classification. You'll learn about grade level classifications from K-12 through graduate and adult learning, learning objectives and their role in educational design, and Bloom's Taxonomy with its six cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create). The chapter also covers curriculum standards including CCSS, NGSS, and ISTE, as well as assessment rubrics. After completing this chapter, students will be able to align MicroSims with educational standards and learning objectives.
