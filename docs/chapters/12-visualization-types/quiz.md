# Quiz: Visualization Types

Test your understanding of MicroSim visualization categories with these questions.

---

#### 1. Why is visualization type important in MicroSim metadata?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. It determines the file size
2. It enables search filtering, curriculum matching, and learning outcome alignment
3. It sets the simulation's color scheme
4. It controls how fast the simulation runs
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Visualization type enables educators to filter by format ("Show me only animations"), match curriculum needs ("I need a chart for data analysis"), plan for device requirements ("3D models need powerful devices"), and align with learning outcomes (different types support different Bloom levels).

    **Concept Tested:** Visualization Type

#### 2. What is an animation in the context of MicroSims?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A static image with text labels
2. A time-sequenced visual progression showing change over time
3. A type of file compression
4. A method for sorting data
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. An animation is a visualization that displays movement or change over time through a sequence of frames or continuous motion. Animations are excellent for showing processes, temporal progression, and dynamic behaviors like planetary orbits or wave propagation.

    **Concept Tested:** Animation

#### 3. When should you choose a chart visualization over a simulation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. When teaching abstract philosophy
2. When you need to compare quantities, show distributions, or display trends
3. When building a video game
4. When the concept requires no visual representation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Charts are best for comparing quantities, showing distributions, and displaying trends through visual elements like bars, lines, or areas. If the learning objective involves analyzing data relationships or understanding numerical patterns, a chart is often the ideal format.

    **Concept Tested:** Chart

#### 4. What distinguishes an interactive simulation from a passive animation?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Simulations have better graphics
2. Simulations allow users to manipulate parameters and explore "what if" scenarios
3. Simulations load faster
4. Simulations use less memory
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Interactive simulations allow users to manipulate parameters and explore "what if" scenarios, seeing how changes affect outcomes. Unlike passive animations that play predetermined sequences, simulations respond to user input, enabling experimentation and discovery.

    **Concept Tested:** Simulation Display

#### 5. What type of visualization is best for showing relationships and connections between entities?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Timeline
2. Chart
3. Network diagram or graph visualization
4. Animation
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Network diagrams and graph visualizations show nodes (entities) connected by edges (relationships). They're ideal for displaying social networks, dependency relationships, concept maps, organizational structures, and any data where connections between items are the focus.

    **Concept Tested:** Network Diagram, Graph Visualization

#### 6. What is a 3D model visualization best suited for?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Displaying text content
2. Showing spatial relationships and structures that need viewing from multiple angles
3. Presenting simple numerical data
4. Creating audio content
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. 3D model visualizations allow students to explore spatial relationships and structures by viewing them from multiple angles. They're excellent for molecular structures, architectural concepts, anatomical models, and any content where three-dimensional understanding is essential.

    **Concept Tested:** 3D Model

---

#### 7. When should you use a timeline visualization?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. When teaching chemistry formulas
2. When showing events or data points arranged chronologically
3. When comparing temperatures
4. When displaying geographic locations
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Timelines display events or data points arranged chronologically along a time axis. They're ideal for historical sequences, biographical events, project milestones, evolutionary progressions, or any content where temporal order and sequence matter.

    **Concept Tested:** Timeline

---

#### 8. What is a dashboard visualization?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A car's instrument panel
2. A visual display organizing multiple metrics or visualizations in a single interface
3. A type of animation effect
4. A file management system
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A dashboard is a visual display organizing multiple data visualizations or controls in a single interface for monitoring or analysis. Dashboards combine charts, metrics, and indicators to provide an overview of a system's state, useful for data analysis units and system monitoring.

    **Concept Tested:** Dashboard

---

#### 9. What type of visualization would you choose to show geographic or spatial data?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Bar chart
2. Network diagram
3. Map visualization
4. Timeline
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. Map visualizations are designed for geographic or spatial data, showing locations, distributions, movements, and regional patterns. Interactive maps can display data layers, markers, routes, and geographic relationships that other visualization types cannot represent effectively.

    **Concept Tested:** Map Visualization

---

#### 10. What is a diagram in the context of MicroSim visualizations?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. A random collection of shapes
2. A static or interactive visual representation showing structure, relationships, or processes
3. A type of animation
4. A method for storing data
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. A diagram is a visual representation showing the structure, relationships, or process of a concept. Diagrams can be static (like a labeled anatomy diagram) or interactive (like a Venn diagram where students drag items to classify them). They're excellent for showing components and their relationships.

    **Concept Tested:** Diagram
