# Faceted Search and Client-Side Search

## Summary

This chapter covers faceted search implementation and lightweight client-side search techniques for MicroSim discovery. You'll learn how facets enable users to filter results by multiple dimensions, how to implement filter controls, and how to use the ItemsJS library for browser-based search without a backend server. The chapter also covers inverted indexes and introduces semantic search concepts. After completing this chapter, students will be able to implement faceted search interfaces for MicroSim collections.
