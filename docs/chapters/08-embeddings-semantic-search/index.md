# Embeddings and Semantic Search

## Summary

This chapter introduces vector embeddings and semantic search techniques for finding related MicroSims based on meaning rather than keywords. You'll learn how embeddings represent text as high-dimensional vectors, how cosine similarity measures semantic relatedness, and how to find similar MicroSims using nearest neighbor algorithms. The chapter also covers dimensionality reduction techniques including PCA and t-SNE for visualizing embedding spaces. After completing this chapter, students will understand how semantic search enhances MicroSim discovery.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Embeddings
2. Vector Representations
3. Cosine Similarity
4. Similar MicroSims
5. Similarity Score
6. Nearest Neighbors
7. Dimensionality Reduction
8. PCA
9. t-SNE
10. Visualization Maps

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 6: Search Fundamentals](../06-search-fundamentals/index.md)
- [Chapter 7: Faceted Search and Client-Side Search](../07-faceted-search-client-side/index.md)
