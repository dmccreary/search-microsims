# User Interface and Controls

## Summary

This chapter covers user interaction levels, control widgets, and layout patterns for MicroSim interfaces. You'll learn about interaction levels from passive viewing through high interaction, and the various user controls including sliders, buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, text inputs, and color pickers. The chapter also covers layout types including fixed, two-panel, and three-panel layouts, as well as color scheme considerations. After completing this chapter, students will be able to design effective user interfaces for MicroSims.
