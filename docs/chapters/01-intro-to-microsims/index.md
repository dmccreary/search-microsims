# Introduction to MicroSims

## Summary

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of MicroSims - small, focused educational simulations designed for web embedding. You'll learn what makes a MicroSim effective, including interactivity, user engagement, and simplicity principles. The chapter also covers how MicroSims can be generated with AI assistance, embedded in web pages using iframes, and designed for reuse across educational contexts. After completing this chapter, students will understand the core characteristics that define a MicroSim and be able to identify levels of complexity and difficulty.
