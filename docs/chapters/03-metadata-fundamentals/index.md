# Metadata Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter introduces metadata concepts and standards that provide the foundation for MicroSim discoverability. You'll learn about metadata standards including the Dublin Core framework, taxonomies and classification systems, and how subject normalization enables consistent searching. The chapter also covers MicroSim-specific standards, schema compliance, tagging approaches including folksonomies and controlled vocabularies. After completing this chapter, students will understand how metadata enables search and discovery of educational resources.
