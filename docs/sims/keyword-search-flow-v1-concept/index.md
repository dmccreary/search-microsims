# Keywords to Search Flow - V1 Animation Concept

<iframe src="main.html" height="402px" width="100%" scrolling="no"></iframe>

## About This Diagram

This is a **static representation** of the V1 animation approach that was rejected during instructional design review. It illustrates why continuous particle animation fails for Understand (L2) level learning objectives with verb "explain."

## Why V1 Failed

The animated approach:

1. **Shows movement without meaning** - Particles flow but don't represent actual data
2. **Obscures data transformations** - Learners can't see tokenization, synonym expansion, or scoring
3. **Prevents prediction** - Continuous animation doesn't allow predict-test-observe pedagogy
4. **Adds cognitive load** - Watching particles while reading tooltips splits attention

## The Better Approach

See the [redesigned step-through version](../keyword-search-flow/index.md) which shows concrete data at each stage and supports self-paced learning.
