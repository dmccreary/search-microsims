## Description

This MicroSim visualizes the cognitive feedback loop that makes interactive learning so effective. The diagram shows the continuous cycle:

1. **Student adjusts parameter** - The learner interacts with controls
2. **MicroSim updates visualization** - The simulation responds in real-time
3. **Student observes change** - Visual feedback is processed
4. **Brain forms hypothesis** - Cognitive processing creates understanding
5. **Student tests new idea** - The cycle continues with new exploration

The animation highlights each step in sequence, demonstrating how this continuous loop creates deeper engagement and learning compared to passive content consumption.

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

- Explain the five steps in the interactive learning feedback loop
- Describe why immediate feedback enhances learning retention
- Compare active learning (through interaction) with passive learning (reading/watching)

### Classroom Activities

1. **Observe and Describe**: Have students watch the animation and identify each step in their own words
2. **Personal Experience**: Ask students to recall a time when hands-on experimentation helped them understand a concept better than reading alone
3. **Design Thinking**: Challenge students to design their own simple interactive that would create this feedback loop for a concept they find difficult

### Discussion Questions

- Why is the brain's "hypothesis formation" step important in the learning cycle?
- How does immediate feedback differ from delayed feedback (like waiting for a test grade)?
- What happens when one part of the loop is missing or weak?
