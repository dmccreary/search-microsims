## About This MicroSim

Explore how the three types of cognitive load compete for limited working memory capacity.

### Learning Objectives

1. Explain how intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load relate to working memory
2. Predict when cognitive overload will occur
3. Understand why reducing extraneous load improves learning

## How to Use

1. **Adjust Concept Complexity**: Move the slider to change intrinsic load (material difficulty)
2. **Adjust Interface Confusion**: Move the slider to change extraneous load (design waste)
3. **Watch the Beaker**: See how loads fill the capacity container
4. **Monitor the Lightbulb**: Brightness shows learning effectiveness
5. **Try Presets**: Click preset buttons to see different scenarios

## Key Concepts

| Load Type | Source | Strategy |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Intrinsic** | Concept complexity | Accept it (can sequence learning) |
| **Extraneous** | Poor design | Minimize it (clean interface) |
| **Germane** | Actual learning | Maximize it (goal of instruction) |

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level**: College
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Bloom's Level**: Understand (L2)

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): Try each preset and observe the results
2. **Prediction** (5 min): Before moving sliders, predict what will happen
3. **Design Challenge** (5 min): Find settings that maximize learning
4. **Discussion** (5 min): How does this apply to MicroSim design?

### Assessment

Students demonstrate understanding by:

- Explaining why extraneous load is the "enemy"
- Identifying when overload occurs
- Suggesting design changes to reduce extraneous load
