## About This MicroSim

Practice evaluating student work using a 4-point rubric across multiple criteria.

### Learning Objectives

1. Apply rubric criteria to evaluate student work
2. Distinguish between performance levels (Beginning to Exemplary)
3. Generate constructive feedback based on rubric scores
4. Compare personal assessments to expert scores

## How to Use

1. **Review Student Work**: Read the description of the student's work in the left panel
2. **Score Each Criterion**: Click cells in the rubric grid to assign scores (0-3)
3. **Generate Feedback**: Click the button to see a summary of your assessment
4. **Compare to Expert**: Toggle expert scores to see how your assessment compares
5. **Try Different Samples**: Switch between Strong, Developing, and Struggling student examples

## Rubric Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | Correctness of calculations and results |
| **Explanation** | Clarity and completeness of reasoning |
| **Exploration** | Number and variety of scenarios tested |
| **Transfer** | Application of concepts to new contexts |

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level**: Undergraduate
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Bloom's Level**: Evaluate (L5)

### Activities

1. **Individual Scoring** (5 min): Score the "Strong Student" sample independently
2. **Peer Discussion** (5 min): Compare scores with a partner and discuss differences
3. **Expert Comparison** (5 min): Reveal expert scores and discuss calibration
4. **Reflection** (5 min): Discuss what makes rubric scoring consistent

### Assessment

Students demonstrate mastery by:

- Scoring within 1 point of expert on 3+ criteria
- Articulating rationale for each score
- Identifying specific evidence from student work
