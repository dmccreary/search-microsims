## About This MicroSim

Critique different feedback approaches by comparing their effectiveness in learning scenarios.

### Learning Objectives

1. Critique different feedback approaches for student errors
2. Identify characteristics of effective feedback
3. Design appropriate feedback for various error types

## How to Use

1. **Select Scenario**: Click different error types to see feedback variations
2. **Compare Panels**: See how each feedback type handles the same error
3. **Check Effectiveness**: Review the effectiveness percentages
4. **Show Research**: Toggle to see research findings about feedback quality

## Feedback Types

| Type | Characteristics | Best For |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | Just correct/incorrect | Quick verification |
| **Directive** | What to fix | Procedural errors |
| **Elaborated** | Why and how | Deep understanding |

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level**: College
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Bloom's Level**: Evaluate (L5)

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): Try all four scenarios
2. **Analysis** (5 min): Identify patterns in effectiveness ratings
3. **Critique** (5 min): Discuss why elaborated feedback is more effective
4. **Design** (5 min): Write feedback for a new scenario

### Assessment

Students demonstrate mastery by:

- Explaining why minimal feedback often fails
- Writing elaborated feedback for new error scenarios
- Matching feedback type to learning goals
