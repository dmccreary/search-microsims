## About This MicroSim

Classify graph layout algorithms by examining examples and identifying appropriate use cases.

### Learning Objectives

1. Identify five major graph layout algorithms
2. Classify when each layout is most appropriate
3. Understand how layout affects perception of graph data

## How to Use

1. **Browse Gallery**: View all five layouts at once
2. **Click to Expand**: See larger examples with descriptions
3. **Compare**: Note how the same data looks different in each layout
4. **Use Bottom Buttons**: Quick-switch between layouts

## Layout Algorithms

| Algorithm | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **Force-Directed** | General exploration, clustering |
| **Hierarchical** | Org charts, taxonomies, trees |
| **Circular** | Comparing connection density |
| **Radial** | Ego networks, influence spread |
| **Grid** | Game boards, matrices |

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level**: Undergraduate
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Bloom's Level**: Understand (L2)

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): View each layout
2. **Classification** (5 min): Match layouts to use cases
3. **Analysis** (10 min): Given a dataset, which layout would you choose?

### Assessment

Students demonstrate mastery by:

- Explaining why hierarchical layout suits org charts
- Describing advantages of force-directed for unknown structure
- Choosing appropriate layouts for sample datasets
