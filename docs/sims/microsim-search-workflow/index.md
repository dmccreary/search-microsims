## Description

This infographic visualizes the complete workflow from a teacher's instructional need to finding the perfect MicroSim for their classroom. The four stages are:

### Stage 1: Teacher Need
The teacher identifies a concept that would benefit from interactive visualization. For example: "I need something to help students understand quadratic equations."

### Stage 2: Search Interface
Using faceted search, the teacher filters by:
- **Subject Area**: Mathematics
- **Grade Level**: High School
- **Topic**: Quadratic equations
- **Interactive**: Yes

### Stage 3: Results Ranked
The search system returns matches ranked by relevance, with quality scores displayed. Teachers can quickly scan results and preview options.

### Stage 4: MicroSim Found!
Success! The teacher can:
- Preview the MicroSim in action
- Copy the embed code with one click
- Save to their personal collection for future use

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

- Describe the four stages of finding educational resources through search
- Explain how faceted search filters help narrow results
- Identify the key features that make search systems effective for educators

### For Instructional Designers

This workflow demonstrates best practices for educational resource discovery:

1. **Start with the learning need** - not the technology
2. **Use multiple filters** - subject, grade, type, etc.
3. **Evaluate quality** - look for ratings and usage data
4. **Test before deploying** - always preview resources first
