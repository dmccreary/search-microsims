## About This MicroSim

Explore and identify the essential controls needed for educational animations.

### Learning Objectives

1. Identify the essential controls of an animation interface
2. Understand the purpose of each control element
3. Recognize best practices for animation UX design

## How to Use

1. **Hover Controls**: Move mouse over buttons to see descriptions
2. **Try Controls**: Click Play, Pause, Restart, Step buttons
3. **Drag Scrubber**: Jump to any point in the animation
4. **Adjust Speed**: Drag the speed slider (0.25x to 2x)
5. **Toggle Loop**: Turn looping on or off

## Essential Controls

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Play/Pause** | Start and stop animation |
| **Restart** | Return to beginning |
| **Step Back/Forward** | Advance frame-by-frame |
| **Scrubber** | Jump to any point |
| **Speed** | Slow for detail, fast for overview |
| **Loop** | Repeat continuously or play once |

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level**: Undergraduate
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes
**Bloom's Level**: Remember (L1)

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): Try each control and observe its effect
2. **Identification** (5 min): List all controls and their purposes
3. **Discussion** (5 min): Which controls are essential vs. optional?

### Assessment

Students demonstrate mastery by:

- Naming all standard animation controls
- Explaining when to use slow motion vs. normal speed
- Describing appropriate use cases for looping
