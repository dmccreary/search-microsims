[Open in Full Screen](main.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary target="_blank" }

## How to Use

1. **Answer the questions** in the left panel:
   - **Allow commercial use?** - Can others profit from work based on yours?
   - **Allow modifications?** - Can others adapt or remix your work?

2. **Watch the decision path** highlight in the center flowchart

3. **View your recommendation** in the right panel with:
   - License badge with icons
   - Plain English explanation
   - Ready-to-copy JSON for your metadata

### Quick Option

Click **"Maximum Freedom (CC0)"** to waive all rights and dedicate your work to the public domain.

### Note on Attribution

Attribution (BY) is actually a third dimension of Creative Commons licensing. All CC licenses except CC0 require attribution—meaning others must credit you when using your work. In this tool:

- **CC0** = No attribution required (public domain)
- **All other licenses** = Attribution required (BY is implicit)

To keep the interface simple, we assume most creators want attribution. The "Maximum Freedom (CC0)" button is provided for those who want to waive all rights, including attribution.

## License Types

| License | Commercial Use | Modifications | Notes |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| CC0 | Yes | Yes | Public domain - no restrictions |
| CC BY | Yes | Yes | Requires attribution |
| CC BY-SA | Yes | Yes (ShareAlike) | Derivatives must use same license |
| CC BY-ND | Yes | No | Commercial OK, but no modifications |
| CC BY-NC | No | Yes | Non-commercial only |
| CC BY-NC-SA | No | Yes (ShareAlike) | Non-commercial + same license |
| CC BY-NC-ND | No | No | Most restrictive - sharing only |
