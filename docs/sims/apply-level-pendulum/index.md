## About This MicroSim

This Apply-level (L3) MicroSim requires students to calculate the period of a simple pendulum, then verify their answer against the simulation.

### Learning Objectives

1. Calculate pendulum period using T = 2π√(L/g)
2. Verify calculations against visual simulation
3. Explore how length and gravity affect period
