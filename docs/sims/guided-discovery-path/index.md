## About This MicroSim

Explore the 9-step guided discovery process that balances exploration with structure.

### Learning Objectives

1. Implement a guided discovery sequence in MicroSim design
2. Understand the purpose of each step in the process
3. Compare guided discovery to pure discovery learning

## How to Use

1. **Navigate Steps**: Use Previous/Next buttons or click path nodes
2. **Read Details**: Each step shows example guidance and purpose
3. **Compare**: Toggle "Show Pure Discovery" to see what's missing without guidance
4. **Auto-play**: Watch the complete sequence unfold automatically

## The 9 Steps

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1. Pose Question | Focus the exploration |
| 2. Constrain Variables | Prevent confusion |
| 3. Explore Freely | Hands-on discovery |
| 4. Prompt Observation | Guide attention |
| 5. Form Hypothesis | Deepen engagement |
| 6. Test Prediction | Build confidence |
| 7. Confirm Discovery | Positive validation |
| 8. Connect to Theory | Link to formal knowledge |
| 9. Transfer | Apply to new contexts |

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level**: Undergraduate
**Duration**: 15-20 minutes
**Bloom's Level**: Apply (L3)

### Activities

1. **Walkthrough** (5 min): Step through all 9 stages
2. **Analysis** (5 min): Toggle comparison to see value of each step
3. **Design Exercise** (10 min): Apply this framework to design a guided discovery MicroSim for a concept of your choice

### Assessment

Students demonstrate mastery by:

- Explaining the purpose of each step
- Designing a guided discovery sequence for a new topic
- Articulating why pure discovery often fails
