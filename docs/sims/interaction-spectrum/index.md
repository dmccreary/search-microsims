## About This MicroSim

This MicroSim helps students understand the spectrum of interaction levels in educational simulations, from passive viewing to highly interactive experiences.

## Description

The Interaction Spectrum visualizes four levels of user interaction in MicroSims:

1. **Passive** - User watches without input (auto-playing animations)
2. **Low** - Minimal controls like play/pause and reset
3. **Medium** - A few adjustable parameters with sliders
4. **High** - Extensive control over many parameters and modes

Students can:
- View the color-coded spectrum from blue (passive) to green (high interaction)
- See icons representing the typical controls at each level
- Toggle detail panels showing characteristics of each level
- Enter Quiz Mode to test their classification skills by dragging example cards

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

1. **Classify** MicroSims by their interaction level
2. **Identify** the characteristics that distinguish each level
3. **Select** appropriate interaction levels for different learning goals

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (5 minutes)
- Discuss why different learning objectives require different interaction levels
- Ask students: "When would you want a passive animation vs. a full lab simulation?"

### Exploration (10 minutes)
1. Have students explore the spectrum, clicking each level
2. Toggle "Show Details" to see characteristics
3. Discuss the relationship between user role and control complexity

### Quiz Activity (10 minutes)
1. Enter Quiz Mode
2. Students drag example cards to classify them on the spectrum
3. Discuss any misclassifications and why certain examples fit their categories

### Reflection (5 minutes)
- Students identify a MicroSim they've used and classify its interaction level
- Discuss how to choose the right level when designing educational content
