## About This MicroSim

This interactive diagram visualizes the standard file organization pattern for MicroSim packages. Hover over each node to learn about the purpose and contents of each file type.

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

1. Describe the standard MicroSim directory structure
2. Explain the purpose of each file type within the package
3. Distinguish between required and optional files
4. Understand how file organization enables discoverability

## How to Use

1. **Hover over nodes** to see detailed descriptions of each file
2. **Blue nodes** indicate required files (index.md, main.html)
3. **Green nodes** indicate optional but recommended files
4. **Gold nodes** represent directories/folders

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the standard file organization for MicroSims
- Identify the purpose of each file type
- Recognize the difference between required and optional files

### Activities
1. Have students hover over each file to read its description
2. Ask students to explain why separating code (main.html) from documentation (index.md) is beneficial
3. Discuss why metadata.json enables search and discovery

### Assessment
- Can students list all five file types in a MicroSim package?
- Can students explain which files are required vs optional?
- Can students describe what information goes in metadata.json?
