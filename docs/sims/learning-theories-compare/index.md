## About This MicroSim

Compare the four major learning theories by examining how each would design a pendulum MicroSim.

### Learning Objectives

1. Compare the four major learning theories
2. Analyze how theory influences design decisions
3. Match design features to theoretical foundations

## How to Use

1. **Explore Quadrants**: Click any theory for detailed view
2. **Compare Two**: Use "Compare Two" to see theories side-by-side
3. **Toggle Theories**: In compare mode, click theory names to swap
4. **Return to Overview**: Click "← Overview" to see all four

## The Four Theories

| Theory | Key Principle | MicroSim Design |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Constructivism** | Build knowledge through exploration | Open-ended discovery |
| **Behaviorism** | Shape behavior through reinforcement | Drill with rewards |
| **Cognitivism** | Process information efficiently | Structured presentation |
| **Experiential** | Learn through experience + reflection | Hands-on experiments |

## Lesson Plan

**Grade Level**: College
**Duration**: 20-25 minutes
**Bloom's Level**: Analyze (L4)

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): Click through all four theories
2. **Comparison** (5 min): Use compare mode to contrast pairs
3. **Analysis** (10 min): For a given learning goal, which theory fits best?
4. **Synthesis** (5 min): How might you combine theories in one MicroSim?

### Assessment

Students demonstrate mastery by:

- Explaining each theory's approach to the same design challenge
- Matching design features to their theoretical basis
- Recommending theories for different learning goals
