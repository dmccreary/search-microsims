## Skills Required for Implementation

The following MicroSims require implementation:

1. **ir-pipeline** - p5.js flowchart with hover text and query tracing
2. **precision-recall-explorer** - p5.js Venn diagram with sliders
3. **ranking-visualizer** - p5.js animated list with score bars
4. **boolean-query-builder** - p5.js query construction with Venn visualization
5. **inverted-index-viz** - p5.js animated index construction and query tracing

## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Level | Count | Elements |
|-------|-------|----------|
| L2 Understand | 3 | IR Pipeline, Ranking Visualizer, Inverted Index |
| L3 Apply | 1 | Boolean Query Builder |
| L4 Analyze | 1 | Precision-Recall Explorer |

Good distribution with emphasis on understanding foundational concepts.
