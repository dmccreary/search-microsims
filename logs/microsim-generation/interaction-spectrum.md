**Generated:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Source
- Chapter: 13-user-interface-controls
- Diagram Title: Interaction Level Spectrum

## Specification
- Type: infographic
- Bloom Level: Understand (L2)
- Bloom Verb: classify
- Learning Objective: Students will classify MicroSims by interaction level by examining examples along a spectrum from passive to highly interactive.

## Files Created
1. `docs/sims/interaction-spectrum/interaction-spectrum.js` - p5.js implementation
2. `docs/sims/interaction-spectrum/main.html` - HTML wrapper
3. `docs/sims/interaction-spectrum/index.md` - Documentation
4. `docs/sims/interaction-spectrum/metadata.json` - Dublin Core metadata

## Features Implemented
- Horizontal gradient spectrum (blue to green)
- Four interaction levels with markers and icons
- Draggable example cards for classification
- Quiz mode for testing understanding
- Detail panels showing characteristics
- Reset functionality

## Instructional Design Check
- Pattern: worked-example with interactive classification
- Alignment: Appropriate for Understand/classify objective
- Rationale: Drag-and-drop classification activity supports categorization learning
