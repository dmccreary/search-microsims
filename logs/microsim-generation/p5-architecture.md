# MicroSim Generation Log: p5-architecture

**Generated:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Source
- Chapter: 14-technical-implementation
- Diagram Title: p5.js Architecture

## Specification
- Type: diagram (flowchart)
- Bloom Level: Understand (L2)
- Bloom Verb: explain
- Learning Objective: Students will explain the p5.js execution model by tracing the flow from initialization through the animation loop.

## Files Created
1. `docs/sims/p5-architecture/p5-architecture.js` - p5.js implementation
2. `docs/sims/p5-architecture/main.html` - HTML wrapper
3. `docs/sims/p5-architecture/index.md` - Documentation
4. `docs/sims/p5-architecture/metadata.json` - Dublin Core metadata

## Features Implemented
- Step-through flowchart visualization
- Animated highlighting of active nodes/edges
- setup(), draw(), and event handler nodes
- Detail panels explaining each function's role
- Next Step, Reset, and Auto Play controls
- Progress indicator at bottom
- Responsive design

## Instructional Design Check
- Pattern: step-through worked example
- Alignment: Appropriate for Understand/explain objective
- Rationale: Step-through allows prediction and tracing of execution flow
