## Specification
- Type: microsim
- Bloom Level: Apply (L3)
- Bloom Verb: use
- Learning Objective: Students will use faceted search to filter a MicroSim collection by applying multiple facet selections and observing how results and counts update dynamically.

## Files Created
1. `docs/sims/faceted-search-simulator/faceted-search-simulator.js` - p5.js implementation
2. `docs/sims/faceted-search-simulator/main.html` - HTML wrapper
3. `docs/sims/faceted-search-simulator/index.md` - Documentation
4. `docs/sims/faceted-search-simulator/metadata.json` - Dublin Core metadata

## Features Implemented
- 20 sample MicroSims with full metadata
- 4 facet groups (Subject, Grade, Framework, Difficulty)
- Checkbox filtering with live counts
- Search box for text filtering
- Active filter chips with remove buttons
- Paginated results (6 per page)
- Clear All Filters button
- OR logic within facet, AND logic across facets

## Instructional Design Check
- Pattern: exploration
- Alignment: Appropriate for Apply/use objective
- Rationale: Interactive filtering lets students practice faceted search
