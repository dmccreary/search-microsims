**Generated:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Source
- Chapter: 07-faceted-search-client-side
- Diagram Title: Client-Side Search Architecture

## Specification
- Type: diagram
- Bloom Level: Understand (L2)
- Bloom Verb: explain
- Learning Objective: Students will explain the data flow in client-side search by tracing how data moves from static files through the browser to search results.

## Files Created
1. `docs/sims/client-side-architecture/client-side-architecture.js` - p5.js implementation
2. `docs/sims/client-side-architecture/main.html` - HTML wrapper
3. `docs/sims/client-side-architecture/index.md` - Documentation
4. `docs/sims/client-side-architecture/metadata.json` - Dublin Core metadata

## Features Implemented
- Static Server component with cloud icon
- Browser component with internal sub-components (Data Layer, Search Engine, UI)
- User stick figure
- Connection arrows (dashed for one-time load, solid for interaction)
- Animated data flow particles
- Hover highlighting on components
- Key annotations about client-side benefits

## Instructional Design Check
- Pattern: reference
- Alignment: Appropriate for Understand/explain objective
- Rationale: Diagram with animation helps students trace data flow
