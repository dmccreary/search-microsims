# MicroSim Generation Log: ir-pipeline

**Generated:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Source
- Chapter: 06-search-fundamentals
- Diagram Title: Information Retrieval Pipeline

## Specification
- Type: workflow
- Bloom Level: Understand (L2)
- Bloom Verb: explain
- Learning Objective: Students will explain the five stages of information retrieval by tracing a search query through the complete pipeline from user input to displayed results.

## Files Created
1. `docs/sims/ir-pipeline/ir-pipeline.js` - p5.js implementation
2. `docs/sims/ir-pipeline/main.html` - HTML wrapper
3. `docs/sims/ir-pipeline/index.md` - Documentation
4. `docs/sims/ir-pipeline/metadata.json` - Dublin Core metadata

## Features Implemented
- Six-stage pipeline visualization (Query → Processing → Index → Matching → Ranking → Results)
- "Trace Query" animation through all stages
- "Step" button for manual progression
- Click any stage for detailed information panel
- Hover tooltips on each stage
- Pre-built index connection visualization
- Reset functionality

## Instructional Design Check
- Pattern: step-through
- Alignment: Appropriate for Understand/explain objective
- Rationale: Step-through allows students to trace query flow through each stage
