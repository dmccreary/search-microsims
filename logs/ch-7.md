### Diagrams/MicroSims Specified
5 interactive elements with full specifications:

| # | Name | Type | Bloom Level |
|---|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Faceted Search Interface Simulator | microsim | Apply (L3) |
| 2 | Client-Side Search Architecture | diagram | Understand (L2) |
| 3 | Facet Index Structure Visualizer | microsim | Analyze (L4) |
| 4 | ItemsJS API Interactive Explorer | microsim | Apply (L3) |

---

## Interactive Elements Summary

| Element Type | Count |
|--------------|-------|
| MicroSims (p5.js) | 3 |
| Diagrams | 1 |
| **Total Interactive** | **4** |

---

## Skills Required for Implementation

The following MicroSims require implementation:

1. **faceted-search-simulator** - p5.js with simulated faceted search logic
2. **client-side-architecture** - p5.js with animated data flow diagram
3. **facet-index-visualizer** - p5.js with set visualization and intersection animation
4. **itemsjs-explorer** - p5.js with embedded ItemsJS library

---

## Bloom's Taxonomy Distribution

| Level | Count | Elements |
|-------|-------|----------|
| L2 Understand | 1 | Client-Side Architecture |
| L3 Apply | 2 | Faceted Search Simulator, ItemsJS Explorer |
| L4 Analyze | 1 | Facet Index Visualizer |

Good distribution with emphasis on practical application.

## Notes

This chapter bridges foundational search concepts (Chapter 6) with practical implementation. The ItemsJS focus provides students with immediately usable skills. The semantic search preview creates natural motivation for the next chapter on embeddings.

The 6-step implementation guide gives students a clear path from understanding to building their own faceted search interfaces.
