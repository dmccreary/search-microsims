These MicroSim search applications and services can be used by both humans and intelligent agents. We will show how to use these services to create better AI MicroSim generators. Finding the right MicroSim is critical for building high-reuse systems where instructors can quickly leverage the work of others and extend the features of a MicroSim for their classroom. We show that great search and similarity measures can help AI MicroSim  generators by using the ideal set of MicroSims to reference when they are building new MicroSims that have a consistent working user interface.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#target-audience","title":"Target Audience","text":"<p>The ideal audience for this course is someone that is already familiar with MicroSim or is curious about how teachers or instructional designers can reuse other similar components.

A learning graph is a graph of concepts used in this textbook.  Each concept is represented by a node in a network graph.  Concepts are connected by directed edges that indicate what concepts each node depends on before that concept is understood by the student.</p> <p>A learning graph is the foundational data structure for intelligent textbooks that can recommend learning paths. A learning graph is like a roadmap of concepts to help students arrive at their learning goals.</p> <p>At the left of the learning graph are prerequisite or foundational concepts.  They have no outbound edges.  They only have inbound edges for other concepts that depend on understanding these foundational prerequisite concepts.  At the far right we have the most advanced concepts in the course.  To master these concepts you must understand all the concepts that they point to.</p> <p>Here are other files used by the learning graph.</p>"},{"location":"learning-graph/#course-description","title":"Course Description","text":"<p>We use the Course Description as the source document for the concepts that are included in this course.

The vis-network format uses <code>nodes</code>, <code>edges</code> and <code>metadata</code> elements with edges containing <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> properties.
