These MicroSim search applications and services can be used by both humans and intelligent agents. We will show how to use these services to create better AI MicroSim generators. Finding the right MicroSim is critical for building high-reuse systems where instructors can quickly leverage the work of others and extend the features of a MicroSim for their classroom. We show that great search and similarity measures can help AI MicroSim  generators by using the ideal set of MicroSims to reference when they are building new MicroSims that have a consistent working user interface.</p>"},{"location":"course-description/#target-audience","title":"Target Audience","text":"<p>The ideal audience for this course is someone that is already familiar with MicroSim or is curious about how teachers or instructional designers can reuse other similar components.

Unlike sprawling educational software that tries to do everything, a MicroSim does one thing exceptionally well.</p> <p>MicroSims are changing how we think about educational content. Instead of static diagrams in textbooks or passive videos, students can manipulate variables, see immediate results, and build intuition through experimentation. When a student can drag a slider and watch how changing the coefficient affects a quadratic equation in real-time, something magical happens in their brain - the concept clicks.</p> <p>Why MicroSims Matter</p> <p>Research consistently shows that interactive learning increases retention by up to 75% compared to passive reading.

A beautifully designed MicroSim is worthless if students click away after two seconds. The good news? Well-designed MicroSims naturally promote engagement through several psychological principles.</p> <p>First, there's the curiosity gap. When students see a slider labeled \"Friction Coefficient,\" many can't resist finding out what happens when they drag it to the maximum. This natural curiosity drives exploration.</p> <p>Second, MicroSims provide immediate gratification. Unlike homework problems where feedback comes days later, MicroSims respond instantly. Change a variable, see the effect. This rapid feedback loop keeps students in a state of flow.</p> <p>Third, MicroSims support self-directed learning. Students can explore at their own pace, revisit confusing concepts, and take ownership of their learning journey.

When you search for \"interactive pendulum simulation for high school physics,\" you're searching through metadata. The simulation itself doesn't contain those words in its JavaScript code. Instead, someone thoughtfully added that descriptive information, and a search engine matched your query against it.</p> <p>Think of metadata as the ultimate wingman for your MicroSim.

They define:</p> <ul> <li>Which fields to include (title, creator, subject, etc.)</li> <li>What values are acceptable (standardized subject lists, date formats)</li> <li>How fields relate to each other (hierarchies, dependencies)</li> <li>Required versus optional information</li> </ul> <p>When everyone follows the same standard, magic happens.

Object nodes (medium green rectangles)    - Represent nested objects    - Label: key name    - Show number of children  3. Array nodes (medium orange rectangles with rounded corners)    - Represent arrays    - Label: key name + [length]    - Show element count  4. Primitive nodes (small circles)    - String: green    - Number: blue    - Boolean: orange    - Null: gray    - Label: key name, hover shows value  Edge types: - Solid lines from parent to children - Labeled with key names where helpful  Interactive features: - Paste JSON in text area to visualize - Click nodes to expand/collapse - Hover to see full values (especially long strings) - Drag nodes to rearrange layout - Zoom with mouse wheel - \"Show Values\" toggle displays values inline - \"Collapse All\" / \"Expand All\" buttons  Sample data: Pre-loaded with MicroSim metadata example  Layout: Hierarchical tree, left-to-right Color scheme: Consistent with JSON data types Animation: Smooth expand/collapse transitions  Implementation: vis-network with custom node rendering"},{"location":"chapters/05-json-and-data-structures/#json-arrays-ordered-collections","title":"JSON Arrays: Ordered Collections","text":"<p>A JSON array is an ordered list of values, wrapped in square brackets <code>[]</code>.

Manually copying metadata from each one would take days\u2014and by the time you finished, new simulations would already be published.

A well-designed pipeline automatically discovers new MicroSims, extracts their metadata, validates quality, and delivers a fresh, searchable collection\u2014all while you're sipping coffee or teaching your next class.</p> <p>In this chapter, you'll learn to build the data infrastructure that powers MicroSim search. Think of it as creating a network of friendly robots that tirelessly explore GitHub, find educational treasures, and organize them for easy discovery.

A learning graph is like a roadmap of concepts to help students arrive at their learning goals.</p> <p>At the left of the learning graph are prerequisite or foundational concepts.  They have no outbound edges.  They only have inbound edges for other concepts that depend on understanding these foundational prerequisite concepts.
